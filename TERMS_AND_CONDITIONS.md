You should be aware that there are certain things that pyamsoft will not take
responsibility for. Certain functions of the app may require the app to have an active
internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network

functionality if you do not have an active Internet connection, or if you do not
have access to Wi-Fi or a connection provided by your mobile network provider.

If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that

you have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.

of battery and you can’t turn it on to use the App, pyamsoft cannot accept responsibility.
