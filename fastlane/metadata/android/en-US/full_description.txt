<p>Share your Android device’s Internet connection with other devices without needing Root.</p><p><i>TetherFi</i> works by creating a Wi-Fi Direct legacy group and an HTTP proxy server. Devices can connect to the broadcasted WiFi network by locating the Wi-Fi SSID displayed in the application and using the password. Once connected to the network, a device can connect to the Internet by setting it’s proxy server settings to the server created by <i>TetherFi.</i></p><p>Please note that <i>TetherFi</i> is still a work in progress and not everything will work. For example, using <i>TetherFi</i> to get an open NAT type on consoles is currently not possible. General "normal" internet browsing should work fine - however it is dependent on the speed and availability of your Android device’s internet connection.</p><p><br><b>Privacy</b></p><p><i>TetherFi</i> respects your privacy. <i>TetherFi</i> is open source, and always will be. <i>TetherFi</i> will never track you, or sell or share your data. <i>TetherFi</i> offers in-app purchases which you may purchase to support the developer.
