  <string
    name="tweaks_description"
  >Tweaks change how %1$s performs in various ways.\n\nAll of these options are completely optional and do not impact network or hotspot performance in any way.</string>

  <string
    name="ignore_vpn_description"
  >When starting, %1$s sometimes has trouble if a VPN is running, and will refuse to start the hotspot until it is turned off.\n\nIf you KNOW your VPN app works fine with %1$s, turn this option on to avoid the blocking dialog.</string>

  <string name="shutdown_no_client_title">Stop Hotspot With No Clients</string>
  <string
    name="shutdown_no_client_description"
  >If the %1$s hotspot has been running for 10 minutes without serving any client devices, shut it down.\n\nAutomatically shutting down the hotspot when it is not being used can save battery.</string>

  <string name="keep_screen_on_title">Keep Screen On</string>
  <string
    name="keep_screen_on_description"
  >Keep the screen on while the Hotspot is running. Once the Hotspot is stopped, the screen will be allowed to turn off again. This tweak is not supported on every device. If Use Wakelock does not work, you should try this tweak or enable Always Alive instead</string>

  <string name="ignore_location_description">
        In order to use Wi-Fi Direct, %1$s may require Location turned on. Not
        every device needs Location on to use Wi-Fi Direct however.\n\nIf you
        KNOW your device does NOT need Location to use Wi-Fi Direct, turn this
        option on to avoid the blocking dialog.
        \n\nPermission for Location/Nearby Devices will still be required for Wi-Fi Direct.</string>

  <string name="hold_wakelock_title">Use Wakelock</string>
  <string
    name="hold_wakelock_description"
  >Using a wakelock will keep your CPU on and will keep processing fast. However, it will consume more battery. On devices that use restrictive power-saving measures, this may not work, and you should try the Keep Screen On tweak, or enable Always Alive instead.</string>
