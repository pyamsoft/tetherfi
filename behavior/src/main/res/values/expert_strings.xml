  <string
    name="expert_socket_timeout_description"
  >This is for Advanced Users.\n\nYou can adjust the timeout, which controls how long %1$s will wait for a connection before closing a socket. For most well behaving, modern websites on a decent connection, you should be fine with the default. If you notice connections are reporting frequent time outs, you should try increasing this value. If you notice high latency, you could try lowering the value</string>
